## About Scale-Balance
Scale-Balance is an app used to balance two weights. It contains two elements, the first being the two positive integer weights (one on the right side and the other on the left side) and the second element being a list of available weights as positive integers.

## Scale-Balnce's goal
The app's goal is to determine if there is a posibility of balancing the scale by using by using the least amount of weights from the list, but using at most two weights.
## How it works
The user enters on both sides the weights (in kg) to be balanced and a set of integers that will be used to balance those weights and clicks on the button 'Balance'.
